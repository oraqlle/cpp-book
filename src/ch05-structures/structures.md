# Structures

A structure or *struct* is a way to aggregate or group related data together while giving
each piece of data a distinct name, unlike tuples. We'll explore; in this chapter, how to
define and instantiate structs, access stored data via *member variables* and invoke
*member functions* on instances of structs.
