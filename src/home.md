# The C++ programming Language

_by Tyler Swann_

This book assumes you are using a C++17 compliant compiler but concepts and topics from
later standards are also covered, notably C++20. See the
["Installation"](getting-started/installation.md) page of the _"Getting Started"_ Chapter
for more details.

> This book is under active development. Much of the material is absent, incomplete or
> subject to change. If you have suggestions create a discussion or issue on
> [GitHub](https://github.com/oraqlle/cpp-book).
